Quickee
=========

An ExpressionEngine extension that adds [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/)/[LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html)/[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)-like functionality to the control panel.

After installing and enabling, simply hit the "q" key to activate Quickee on any control panel page. Start typing the name of a link from the main navigation header and the choices will appear. The more you type, the more narrowed the results will be. The searching is "fuzzy", so a search for "fm" will produce "File Manager" as one of the top results.
